<b>Problem Statement</b><br>
<p>
The Good Seed supermarket chain would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to
alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage.
</p>
<p>Below are some considerations:
<li> The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol.</li> 
<li> Computer vision methods can be used to determine the age of a person from a photo.</li> 
<li> The task then is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age. </li> 
</p> 
<p>FTo start working on the task, you'll have a set of photographs of people with their ages indicated.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b> Solution</b><br>
Build an Articifial Neural Network (ANN) model for regression with a low RMSE that will result into a scatter index (SI) that is less than 30% <br>
